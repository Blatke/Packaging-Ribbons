This is a female inner-top of packaging ribbons. Let your waifu package herself into a gift to you!

## How to Use
Download the Packaging Ribbons.zip for the latest version on the [Release](https://github.com/Blatke/Packaging-Ribbons/releases) page, and uncompress it. Put the .zipmod file into your **mods** folder, and put the .png file that is a coordinate card into your **UserData\coordinate\female** folder.

Go to Chara Maker to put the coordinate card on your chara. Or in Studio, load the coordinate card onto your chara.

You can use MaterialEditor to adjust its base color or other parameters.

In some poses, there might be overlaps or clips between this inner-top and the character's body. In Studio, Select the character on the Workspace, and open the adv. mode of HS2PE / AIPE, then find the Blend Shapes tab on which there are two additional options: Ribbon.Arm and Ribbon.Body, moving the slider of the former can make fatter the ribbons on the arm; and that of the latter, the ribbons on the body.
